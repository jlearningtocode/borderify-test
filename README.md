# Borderif Test
This is just a simple repo where I am completing the browser extension tutorial on [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension).

I barely know the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so this will be an interesting little project.
Afterwards I plan to make small extensions to the project just to extend my knowledge.

I am putting this on GitHub just so I can get used to the entire Git and GitHub developer workflow.
I am open to criticism but I currently do not plan to accept PRs or anything like that seeing that this is not a serious project.
